GprofGmonStale_msg=Gprof Data File Out Of Date
GprofGmonStaleExplanation_msg=The gmon.out file is older than the executable being run.  It is likely that \
the file was generated previously and the executable just run was not composed of any objects compiled with the \"-pg\" option.


# Messages shown when gmon.out is not found.
GprofNoGmonOut_title=Gprof launch error
GprofNoGmonOut_body=\
gmon.out could not be found. \n\
Either this file has been generated in another directory (it may happen if your   \n\
program runs chdir()), or your program has not been compiled with \"-pg\" option. \n\n\
\
Either browse to find gmon.out or cancel the launch and add the -pg flag to \n\
your compiler and linker makefile, rebuild your project and run gprof again.

GprofNoGmonOut_BrowseWorkSpace=Browse Eclipse workspace to find gmon.out
GprofNoGmonOut_BrowseFileSystem=Browse your file system to find gmon.out
GprofNoGmonOut_CancleLaunch=Cancel the launch and adjust makefile
