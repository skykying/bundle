<h1>Importing into the Workbench</h1>
<p>Importing from an SFTP server requires that the project or folder 
  into which you want to import exists before you run the import operation. To 
  import the contents of a remote location into the Workbench: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the target project or folder exists in the workspace. If you 
    are importing into a new project, first create the new project. If the project 
    is to contain Java code then first create an empty Java project. Otherwise, 
    create a simple project.</li>
  <li>Open the import wizard <b>File &gt; Import...</b> and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">SFTP 
    </span>
 and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select to import the files into a folder and select the target folder and 
    click <strong>Next</strong>. If you created a project in step 1, select the 
    project from the list. </li>
  <li>On the next page, Enter the appropriate information for connecting to the 
    remote location and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the wizard you can then browse the remote folders that exist on the server. 
    Select the folder to import and click <strong>Next</strong>. </li>
  <li>On the final page, select which resources to import by checking them in 
    the view. You can also browse the contents of the remote files. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> and the checked files will be imported into 
    the target folder (or the project you created in step 1).</li>
  <li>Once the files have been imported you can either re-import at some other 
    time to fetch new content from the server, or you can use the <a
 href="synchronization.html">Synchronize</a> view.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
