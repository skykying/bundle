Installation
============
You need Eclipse SDK 3.3(or higher) to enjoy this software. 
After installing and running it,

1) Help > Software Updates > Find and Install...
2) Choose "Search for new features to install".
3) Click "New Remote Site...", and then put "http://eclipse.jcraft.com/"
   for the URL field.
4) Choose "SFTP Plug-in", and then click "Select Required" button.

For Eclipse Platform 3.2, try the Update site "http://eclipse.jcraft.com/3.2/".


Tips
====
* The location 'sftp://192.168.0.1/tmp' will allow you to get access to
  'tmp' directory under user's home directory. On the other hand,
  'sftp://192.168.0.1//tmp' will point to '/tmp' directory on the remote.
