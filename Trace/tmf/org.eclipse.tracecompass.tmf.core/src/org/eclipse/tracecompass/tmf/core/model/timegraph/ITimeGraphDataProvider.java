/**
 * Interface that provides data for states to time. Such a model has a
 * collection of {@link ITimeGraphEntryModel}s, which can be organized into a
 * tree. Each entry may have a {@link ITimeGraphRowModel} that contains
 * consecutive {@link ITimeGraphState}s associated to it by its unique ID. The
 * entries can also be connected by {@link ITimeGraphArrow}s which go from a
 * source entry at a start time to a destination entry after a certain duration.
 * These items can also display additional information in tool tips.
 *
 * Typical usage is to build a tree of {@link ITimeGraphEntryModel}s, and fetch
 * its {@link ITimeGraphRowModel} to associate the relevant line of
 * {@link ITimeGraphState}s to each entry. {@link ITimeGraphArrow}s then
 * describe additional relations from one state to another.
 * {@link ITimeGraphState#getValue()} can be used to assign a color to a state.
