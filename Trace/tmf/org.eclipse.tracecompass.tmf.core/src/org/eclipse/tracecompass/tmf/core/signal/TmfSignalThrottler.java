/**
 * "Buffer" between a TmfComponent and the signal manager. You can use this if
 * you want to throttle the amount of signals your component will send.
 *
 * It works by specifying a delay, then calling {@link #queue}. The signals will
 * only be really sent if no other call to {@link #queue} happens within $delay
 * milliseconds afterwards. This guarantees that only the *last* signal is
 * actually broadcasted.
 *
 * Note that this class does not discriminate for signal types, sources, or
 * whatever. If you want to throttle different signals in different ways, you
 * can use multiple signal throttlers in your component and call them
 * accordingly.
