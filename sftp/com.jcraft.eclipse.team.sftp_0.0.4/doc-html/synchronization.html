<h1>Synchronizing with a remote location</h1>
<p>Once you have imported or exported a project of folder to a remote location 
  the SFTP support remembers the association between the local resources 
  and the remote location. This means that you can use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Synchronize View</span> to move files back-and-forth 
  between the local project and the remote location, as well as keep them synchronized 
  (i.e. upload and download changes). </p>
<p>To create a Synchronization first open the Team Synchronizing perspective, 
  then from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Synchronize View</span> click 
  on the first button to open the Create Synchronization wizard. Select
  the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">SFTP</span> synchronizations. On the next page, 
  you can select which resources in your workspace should be included in the synchronization. 
  Only those resources that have been previously imported or exported will be 
  available. <br>
</p>
<p>When the synchronization is added to the Synchronize View you can use the context 
  menu to upload and download changes.
